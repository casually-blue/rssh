# rssh
RSSH is a pure rust implementation of the ssh protocol, currently under construction.

If you're looking for something that's a bit more complete checkout (russh)[https://github.com/Eugeny/russh] or (thrussh)[https://nest.pijul.com/pijul/thrussh]

Currently just the initial identification string validation is working. That can be found (here)[https://github.com/casually-blue/rssh/blob/main/rust-ssh/src/identification/mod.rs]
